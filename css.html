<p> The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. </p>

<p style="font-family: courier; color: #630f07;"> Why wouldn't you ever go out with me in school?
You always went out with those guys
Who thought they were so cool.
And I was just nobody to you,
Nobody to you, nobody to you.
But it's the early 19th century
And we're gonna take this country back
From people like us who don't just think about things
People who make things happen.
Sometimes with guns
Sometimes with speeches too.
And also other things.
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
This is the age of
This is the age of,
This is the age of Jackson
Take a stand against the elite [Sigh]
They don't care anything for us
And we will eat sweet democracy
And let them eat our dust,
Eat our dust, eat our dust
Cause it's the early 19th century
We'll take the land back from the indians
We'll take the land back from the French and Spanish
And other people in other European countries
And other countries too
And also other places
I'm pretty sure it's our land anyway
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
Populism, Yea Yea
This is the age of Jackson
This is the age of Jackson
This is the age of Jackson
This is the age of Jackson
This is the age of,
This is the age of Jackson </p>
